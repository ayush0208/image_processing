# Image Processing

##  Low Pass filtering in Fourier Domain
* low_pass_filter.m: MATLAB file containing code for low-pass filtering in Fourier domain with a square filter with D0 = 25 pixels i.e. side of the square filter function (H(u,v)) = 50 pixels

* input.bmp: input image

* output.png: image after applying the low pass filter

## Image Compression using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
* DCT_Image_Compression.m: MATLAB file containing code for DCT_Image_Compression.m showing application of DCT to the image cameraman.tif

* Contains original image, reconstructed image after lossy compression and error image showing absolute error during transformation
